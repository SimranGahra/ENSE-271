### Project 2- Competitor Analysis and Content Audit

#### Description
For this assignment, I undertook a competitor analysis and content audit of a small website consisting of 3 to 5 pages. The objective was to prepare for a redesign by thoroughly analyzing the existing content and structure of the site. I created a sitemap and an asset inventory to gain insights into the current state of the website.

#### Role
- Sole contributor responsible for conducting the competitor analysis and content audit.
- Tasked with identifying all pages, including those not listed in the main navigation, and documenting all assets such as icons, text, images, and carousel images used in hero banners.
- Ensured that filenames for assets followed the Linux standard format for web server compatibility.

#### Technologies Used
- Manual inspection and analysis techniques
- Tools: Figma

#### Outcome
- **Sitemap**: Created a visual representation of the website's structure, outlining all pages and their hierarchical relationship.
- **Asset Inventory**: Compiled a comprehensive list of all assets used on the website, including images, icons, and textual content, with appropriate file naming conventions.
- **Website Used**: [Dalya Baron's Portfolio](/Project%202:%20Competitor%20Analysis%20and%20Content%20Audit/Dayla%20Baraon%20Portfolio/) - https://www.dalyabaron.com/
