Stories on Board - Extra Features
-I utalized the color card features to color code the tasks that are split
 into three sections for the three differnt epics.
-I also created three personas, one personas for each epics I have. The third Epic 
 I created was a dispiction of my contibution. I used that instead of the default persona 
 form Stories on board.
-I also explored the idea of annotations on a few of the tasks/cards to give a deeper 
 understanding of my thinking. For example, I annoted a card as "needs discussion" as I am 
 unsure of the idea or whether it can be moved to a different epic section depends as to 
 where the discussion led.
