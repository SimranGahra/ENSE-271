### Project 4: Virtual Tour Webpage Prototype

#### Description
For this lab project, I created a virtual tour prototype of a simple webpage simulating a tour of a real-world or fictional location. The virtual tour includes a home page, a menu for easy navigation, and three landmark pages, each showcasing a specific feature of the locale. Each landmark page includes a name, a set of images, and a text description, presented in an interactive image container. Different types of interactions are utilized across the pages to enhance user engagement.

#### Role
- Sole contributor responsible for conceptualizing and implementing the virtual tour prototype.
- Designed the layout, interactions, and content presentation for each page to provide an immersive touring experience.
- Incorporated Smart Animate for a transformative effect on at least one page, with explicit documentation within the Figma file.

#### Technologies Used
- Tools: Figma

#### Outcome
- Successfully developed a virtual tour prototype with seamless navigation and engaging interactions.
- Leveraged Smart Animate to add dynamic visual elements, enhancing the user experience and immersion.
