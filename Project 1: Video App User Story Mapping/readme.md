### Project 1: Video App User Story Map

#### Description
This project involved creating a comprehensive User Story Map for a video sharing application, akin to platforms like YouTube or TikTok, focusing on the user experience and interaction with the application. Utilizing StoriesOnBoard, I developed a private, solo board to visually organize and prioritize the application's development from a user-centric perspective.

#### Role
- Sole contributor in mapping out user stories, defining epics, steps, and tasks to cover the essential functionalities of a video sharing application.
- Responsible for the identification and categorization of user roles such as viewers, content creators, and administrators to ensure a holistic view of the application's ecosystem.

#### Technologies Used
- StoriesOnBoard

#### Outcome
- **Epics and Walking Skeleton**: Successfully outlined at least three major epics in the backbone of the User Story Map, along with six steps in the walking skeleton to depict the core journey of the application's users.
- **Tasks**: Developed over 18 tasks, each labeled with a name, status, and time estimate to provide a clear roadmap for the application's development. Enhanced the detail of at least three tasks using various markdown features to improve clarity and comprehension.
- **Releases**: Defined at least two release phases for the application, categorizing tasks into scheduled and unscheduled, to strategize the rollout of features effectively.
- **Extra Features**: Experimented with additional StoriesOnBoard features such as card colors, annotations, and personas to enrich the user story map and provide deeper insights into user needs and preferences.
