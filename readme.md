## Introduction

Hello! I'm Simran Gahra, a student at University Of Regina. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work and projects undertaken in the ENSE 271 lab. Each project reflects my commitment to learning and advancing in people centered design.

## Projects Overview


### Project 1: Video App User Story Map

#### Description
This project involved creating a comprehensive User Story Map for a video sharing application, akin to platforms like YouTube or TikTok, focusing on the user experience and interaction with the application. Utilizing StoriesOnBoard, I developed a private, solo board to visually organize and prioritize the application's development from a user-centric perspective.

#### Role
- Sole contributor in mapping out user stories, defining epics, steps, and tasks to cover the essential functionalities of a video sharing application.
- Responsible for the identification and categorization of user roles such as viewers, content creators, and administrators to ensure a holistic view of the application's ecosystem.

#### Technologies Used
- StoriesOnBoard

#### Outcome
- **Epics and Walking Skeleton**: Successfully outlined at least three major epics in the backbone of the User Story Map, along with six steps in the walking skeleton to depict the core journey of the application's users.
- **Tasks**: Developed over 18 tasks, each labeled with a name, status, and time estimate to provide a clear roadmap for the application's development. Enhanced the detail of at least three tasks using various markdown features to improve clarity and comprehension.
- **Releases**: Defined at least two release phases for the application, categorizing tasks into scheduled and unscheduled, to strategize the rollout of features effectively.
- **Extra Features**: Experimented with additional StoriesOnBoard features such as card colors, annotations, and personas to enrich the user story map and provide deeper insights into user needs and preferences.

### Project 2: Competitor Analysis and Content Audit

#### Description
For this assignment, I undertook a competitor analysis and content audit of a small website consisting of 3 to 5 pages. The objective was to prepare for a redesign by thoroughly analyzing the existing content and structure of the site. I created a sitemap and an asset inventory to gain insights into the current state of the website.

#### Role
- Sole contributor responsible for conducting the competitor analysis and content audit.
- Tasked with identifying all pages, including those not listed in the main navigation, and documenting all assets such as icons, text, images, and carousel images used in hero banners.
- Ensured that filenames for assets followed the Linux standard format for web server compatibility.

#### Technologies Used
- Manual inspection and analysis techniques
- Tools: Figma

#### Outcome
- **Sitemap**: Created a visual representation of the website's structure, outlining all pages and their hierarchical relationship.
- **Asset Inventory**: Compiled a comprehensive list of all assets used on the website, including images, icons, and textual content, with appropriate file naming conventions.

### Project 3: UI Design Recreation from Dribbble

#### Description
For this assignment, I selected a UI design from Dribbble, a platform where designers showcase their UI work. The chosen design includes at least 10 unique components, which I attempted to recreate using Figma, a collaborative interface design tool.

#### Role
- Sole contributor responsible for analyzing the selected UI design and recreating it in Figma.
- Tasked with identifying and reproducing each unique visual element, including images, buttons, icons, and geometrical shapes, adhering to the specified rules.

#### Technologies Used

### Project 4: Virtual Tour Webpage Prototype

#### Description
For this lab project, I created a virtual tour prototype of a simple webpage simulating a tour of a real-world or fictional location. The virtual tour includes a home page, a menu for easy navigation, and three landmark pages, each showcasing a specific feature of the locale. Each landmark page includes a name, a set of images, and a text description, presented in an interactive image container. Different types of interactions are utilized across the pages to enhance user engagement.

#### Role
- Sole contributor responsible for conceptualizing and implementing the virtual tour prototype.
- Designed the layout, interactions, and content presentation for each page to provide an immersive touring experience.
- Incorporated Smart Animate for a transformative effect on at least one page, with explicit documentation within the Figma file.

#### Technologies Used
- Tools: Figma

#### Outcome
- Successfully developed a virtual tour prototype with seamless navigation and engaging interactions.
- Leveraged Smart Animate to add dynamic visual elements, enhancing the user experience and immersion.

### Project 5: Persona-driven Job Hunting Website

#### Description
For this project, I built a website tailored to a persona created for a job hunting application. Following the provided Figma persona template, I considered the goals, tasks, needs, and frustrations of the user to design a website that addresses their specific requirements. The website was created using WordPress on the Local development environment, with a focus on conveying elements of the persona's personality and addressing their job hunting challenges.

#### Role
- Sole contributor responsible for designing and developing the WordPress website.
- Utilized the persona's traits, interests, and goals to inform the website's content and design decisions.
- Implemented site builder blocks and static pages to showcase the persona's interests, goals, and pain points effectively.

#### Technologies Used
- WordPress: Content management system for website development.
- Local by Flywheel: Local development environment for WordPress.
- Figma: Design tool for creating the persona template.
- Text-generation site: Used for generating blog content (chatGPT).

#### Outcome
- Successfully created a home page that reflects the persona's personality and interests, providing visitors with insights into their character.
- Developed three static pages linked to the home page, each focusing on specific goals or tasks relevant to the persona's job hunting journey.
- Established a blog page with three entries, addressing the persona's needs and pain points related to job searching.
