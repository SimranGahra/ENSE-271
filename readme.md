## Introduction

Hello! I'm Simran Gahra, a student at University Of Regina. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work and projects undertaken in the ENSE 271 lab. Each project reflects my commitment to learning and advancing in people centered design.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Video App User Story Map

### Project 1: Video App User Story Map

#### Description
This project involved creating a comprehensive User Story Map for a video sharing application, akin to platforms like YouTube or TikTok, focusing on the user experience and interaction with the application. Utilizing StoriesOnBoard, I developed a private, solo board to visually organize and prioritize the application's development from a user-centric perspective.

#### Role
- Sole contributor in mapping out user stories, defining epics, steps, and tasks to cover the essential functionalities of a video sharing application.
- Responsible for the identification and categorization of user roles such as viewers, content creators, and administrators to ensure a holistic view of the application's ecosystem.

#### Technologies Used
- StoriesOnBoard

#### Outcome
- **Epics and Walking Skeleton**: Successfully outlined at least three major epics in the backbone of the User Story Map, along with six steps in the walking skeleton to depict the core journey of the application's users.
- **Tasks**: Developed over 18 tasks, each labeled with a name, status, and time estimate to provide a clear roadmap for the application's development. Enhanced the detail of at least three tasks using various markdown features to improve clarity and comprehension.
- **Releases**: Defined at least two release phases for the application, categorizing tasks into scheduled and unscheduled, to strategize the rollout of features effectively.
- **Extra Features**: Experimented with additional StoriesOnBoard features such as card colors, annotations, and personas to enrich the user story map and provide deeper insights into user needs and preferences.

### Project 2: Competitor Analysis and Content Audit

#### Description
For this assignment, I undertook a competitor analysis and content audit of a small website consisting of 3 to 5 pages. The objective was to prepare for a redesign by thoroughly analyzing the existing content and structure of the site. I created a sitemap and an asset inventory to gain insights into the current state of the website.

#### Role
- Sole contributor responsible for conducting the competitor analysis and content audit.
- Tasked with identifying all pages, including those not listed in the main navigation, and documenting all assets such as icons, text, images, and carousel images used in hero banners.
- Ensured that filenames for assets followed the Linux standard format for web server compatibility.

#### Technologies Used
- Manual inspection and analysis techniques
- Tools: Figma

#### Outcome
- **Sitemap**: Created a visual representation of the website's structure, outlining all pages and their hierarchical relationship.
- **Asset Inventory**: Compiled a comprehensive list of all assets used on the website, including images, icons, and textual content, with appropriate file naming conventions.

- Tasked with identifying and reproducing each unique visual element, including images, buttons, icons, and geometrical shapes, adhering to the specified rules.

#### Outcome
- Successfully recreated the selected UI design in Figma, ensuring to create or find suitable replacements for all required components.
- Aimed for accuracy and attention to detail while maintaining the essence and aesthetics of the original design.
