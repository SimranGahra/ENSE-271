### Project 5: Persona-driven Job Hunting Website

#### Description
For this project, I built a website tailored to a persona created for a job hunting application. Following the provided Figma persona template, I considered the goals, tasks, needs, and frustrations of the user to design a website that addresses their specific requirements. The website was created using WordPress on the Local development environment, with a focus on conveying elements of the persona's personality and addressing their job hunting challenges.

#### Role
- Sole contributor responsible for designing and developing the WordPress website.
- Utilized the persona's traits, interests, and goals to inform the website's content and design decisions.
- Implemented site builder blocks and static pages to showcase the persona's interests, goals, and pain points effectively.

#### Technologies Used
- WordPress: Content management system for website development.
- Local by Flywheel: Local development environment for WordPress.
- Figma: Design tool for creating the persona template.
- Text-generation site: Used for generating blog content (chatGPT).

#### Outcome
- Successfully created a home page that reflects the persona's personality and interests, providing visitors with insights into their character.
- Developed three static pages linked to the home page, each focusing on specific goals or tasks relevant to the persona's job hunting journey.
- Established a blog page with three entries, addressing the persona's needs and pain points related to job searching.
